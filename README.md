# MTLManagedObjectAdapter

[![Carthage compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Carthage-compatible-4BC51D.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

`MTLManagedObjectAdapter` is an adapter for the
[Mantle](https://github.com/Mantle/Mantle) model framework that converts between
`MTLModel` instances and Core Data managed objects.

## License

`MTLManagedObjectAdapter` is released under the MIT license. See
[LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).

## 2xPer Note:
Did not figure out how to use "extobjc" subspec with Carthage, so this workspace does not build on its own. It works fine using as a Pod, as we define the Mantle/extobjc pod as dependency.
